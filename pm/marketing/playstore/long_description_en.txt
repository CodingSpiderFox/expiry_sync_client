This is a BETA Version!

- Scan a product's barcode before you put it in your fridge, cupboard etc.
- Manually add details, like the expiration date or a product image
- Sort by expiration date, time of adding an entry, or name.
- Be reminded before a product expires (automatic alert at a configurable time of the day)
- Synchronize the entries with other devices (currently only possible by using the same ExpirySync user on each device).
- Offline mode (in case you're only using one device)


For developers: This project is open source:

- https://github.com/lentschi/expiry_sync_client - For the client (the app)
- https://github.com/lentschi/expiry_sync_server - For the server, that is used by the app (default setting; can be changed in the app's preferences)
